# DaNoo v5.2 - Intelligence & Development Rules

## Core Directive
Maintain the integrity of the "Risk-First" Institutional Meta Allocation Engine. Every change must prioritize capital preservation, operational stability, and execution security.

## Architecture Guidelines
- **Math Parity**: All technical indicators must match the deterministic math established in the `reference_files` and `core/strategy_library.py`. Do NOT use standard libraries (like TA-Lib) unless specifically asked; maintain custom parity for backtest consistency.
- **Async Efficiency**: Use `asyncio` for the main loop, Web UI (FastAPI), and Telegram polling. Avoid blocking calls.
- **Unified State**: Maintain a shared state between the `RegimeEngine`, `ExecutionEngine`, and the two UIs (Web and Telegram).

## UI/UX Standards
- **Futuristic Aesthetic**: Web UI updates must follow the "Institutional Cyberpunk" theme (Glassmorphism, neon accents, Outfit/Space Mono fonts).
- **Instructional Flow**: The Chat/Intel Interface is the primary way to interact with the OpenClaw agent. Ensure responses are professional and data-driven.

## Security & Governance
- **Zero Secrets**: NEVER hardcode API keys or Telegram tokens. Refer only to `SETTINGS` or `secrets.env`.
- **Git Hygiene**: Respect the `.gitignore`. Data pull CSVs and logs should stay local or in the File Vault, not in the repo.
- **OpenClaw Governance**: Follow the skill audit policy: line-by-line review, pinned versions, and "discovery only" usage.

## Development Workflow
1. **Analyze Regime**: Before suggesting trade logic changes, consider the 5 market regimes: BULL_TREND, BEAR_TREND, RANGING, COMPRESSED, HIGH_VOLATILITY.
2. **Verify Execution**: All trade execution logic must pass through the `ExecutionValidator` check.
3. **Log Visibility**: Significant engine changes must be reflected in the Web UI System Logs.
